<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the Sudoku Play app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by WLC Creates (hereby referred to as "Developer") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

<br><strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
<p>The Application does not obtain any personal information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the Application.</p>

<br><strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</strong>
<p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

<br><strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
<p>The Application displays advertisements via Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use data according to its own privacy policy to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. You can review Google's privacy practices for advertising <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Apart from this ad serving, the Application itself does not collect or share any user information with third parties.</p>

<br><strong>Advertising</strong>
<p>This Application uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may use collected data to provide relevant ads. You can learn more about how Google uses data from ads and manage your ad preferences in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ads Policy</a>.</p>

<br><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. For personalized ads, you can also manage your preferences through your device settings or Google's Ads Settings.</p>

<br><strong>Children</strong>
<p>The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>The Developer does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Developer encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Developer encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Developer through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Developer (<a href="mailto:wlc.creates@gmail.com">wlc.creates@gmail.com</a>) so that necessary actions can be taken. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>

<br><strong>Security</strong>
<p>The Developer is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since the Application does not collect any personal information, there is minimal risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p>
